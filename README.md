This will download data from https://github.com/zeddidragon/helldivers-calc/blob/main/data/ on first run.
Then it collates the data and displays it in a GUI window with drop down menus for calculating damage vs helldivers.
Unfortunately I wasn't able to find good info for enemy attacks, so this tool is only functional for calculating helldiver weapons vs helldiver hp + damage reduction values.
